Hi All👋🏻
I want to show you my SwiftUI version of this [cool design](https://dribbble.com/shots/17227575-Poetics-Poem-App-Concept) 📖
All animations are created by me. Compared to the previous post, now there are no bugs with ScrollView and the scroll position remains the same 🕺
I liked the mechanics of showing the poems that are from the selected author 🏔
Design by: Salman Khan 💪
